## Coursework
### Learning Outcomes:
This assignment assesses the following learning outcomes:
1. Recognize and make distinctions with regard to typical human/computer
interaction
2. Analyse and contrast the design issues relating to different system
environments
3. Formulate and construct designs for human-cantered computer systems
4. Realise key elements of design in an appropriate object-orientated language
5. Evaluate and assess the effectiveness of different designs in different situations
### Specification:
This coursework requires students to form teams of five (5) to eight (8) members to
carry out an interactive software development exercise. It is suggested to choose a
specific business problem from any domain (telecom, finance, entertainment, etc.) and
develop a suitable UI/UX design for the selected scenario. The business problem
could be either a revamp of an existing system or a novel business problem. For
example, revamping of government agriculture (www.doa.gov.lk) website by
addressing the existing usability problems could be an interesting problem.
The aim of this coursework is to apply the theoretical concepts learned during the
lectures in a practical scenario. With this coursework, students will get an opportunity
to exercise their user interface design abilities. Creativity in balancing usability with the
constraints of the interface will be essential to successfully completing this
assignment. When making your designs, consider the unique needs of the target users
for the proposed software. The functionalities you are planning to implement will be
based on the scope of your project. You are expected to get the approval for the
functionalities of your proposal from the lecturer before the implementation.
Your design should include at least 20 interfaces (minimum 4 interfaces for one
member in the group) and they must be well integrated. Overall, it should be a
conceptual solution for the identified problem. However, students are free to make
assumptions where necessary. Students are encouraged to follow agile-scrum or
similar approach in the project.
### Deliverables:
Students are required to produce a working, interactive prototype for the chosen
scenario. This development is associated with two main deliverables as mentioned in
Table 1.

Table 1: Assessments Structure

# Deliverable 1 – Project Report
This is a group report that should include the followings.
* Cover page
* Table of contents
* Introduction
* Introduction to project
* Problem statement
* PACT Analysis
* User Profiles
* Task Analysis diagrams
* Lo-fidelity prototypes
* Design principles used and justification
* Prototype
* Technical specifications
* Screen designs with descriptions
* Usability Evaluation Results
* Conclusion
* References
Written work must be saved as a .pdf/.doc/.docx and include a word count under the
title and use Harvard Referencing. This should be a maximum of 5000 words
excluding references (every 50 words over = loss of 1% of your final mark). The project
report and presentation slides should be submitted via DLE.

###### Submission date: 4th May 2020

# Deliverable 2 – Presentation and Demonstration
Students should be prepared for a short presentation indicating how usability is
achieved in the developed software prototype. Students may additionally show their
prototypes as well. The working prototype must run on a laptop computer with no
specialist software or servers, i.e. some acceptable technologies to use would be:
* HTML + JavaScript/Flash/Photoshop
* Java, VB.Net, Visual C++ or C# that is saved as and can run as an .exe
* A fully interactive PowerPoint presentation emulating a working interface
Each student is expected to explain his/her contribution and face a Q & A session. All
students are expected to be physically present and no late submissions will be
permitted.
**Please note that this assignment is not a software development exercise.
Hence marks will not be given for the technical software development. Marks
will be given how students understand Usability and HCI concepts and how they
transfer that knowledge into the practice using the software prototype.**

###### Presentations (Viva): 11 May 2020 Onwards
